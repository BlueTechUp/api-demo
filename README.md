# Ripple API Intro Presentation

This project is a slide deck introducing Ripple APIs for XRP.

The intended audience is developers who may be familiar with other
distributed ledger technology.  During the presentation, the audience
should become familiar enough with Ripple APIs that they can start to
automate processes sending and receiving XRP.  The presentation
includes links to more detailed documentation for each of the examples
shown.

The deck is not intended to be self-service.  It should be presented
with expert voice-over.

The deck uses [remark](https://remarkjs.com/), a JavaScript-based presentation issue.
This allows the slide deck to make calls
into [Ripple JavaScript API](https://ripple.com/build/rippleapi/) while moving from one slide to the
next.
